"""Test helpers shared between conftest and the test modules.

Kept out of `conftest.py` because conftest is loaded by pytest rather than imported, so importing
*from* it is fragile — this module is a plain import that works the same way everywhere.

An ITSM caller's `subject_ref` is their directory id: OWN scope reads the incidents / requests
whose `requester_id` is that id. There is no per-service "employee" object here, so the helpers
take a bare `subject_ref` uuid.
