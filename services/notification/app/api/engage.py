"""HTTP surface for the `engage` product: an organization's own sending identity.

A second router on this service rather than more routes in `routes.py`, because it is a second
*product*. `notification` is the platform's transactional plumbing — templates, rules, the
message log — and every route there is gated on the `notification` entitlement. Engage is what a
customer buys, gated on `engage`, built from its own catalogue. Two products served by one
process is only a boundary if the gates tell them apart, and one file per gate is how that stays
visible.

Mounted behind the gateway's `/api/v1/engage` prefix, so every path here begins `/engage/...`.
Reads go through `selectors`, writes through `services`; no route builds a query and none opens
a transaction of its own — the chokepoint owns it.

**Nothing here returns a credential.** `ConnectionOut` has no field derived from the app
password, and the sealed DKIM key has no field at all. The single place either plaintext exists
is the SMTP handshake in `services._transport_for_connection`.
